Analyze my project. 
I am learning apache flink and for this query to test the stream processor, 
please generate a simple csv file with 50 entries.

Here is the query:
"CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'filesystem',
    'path' = '/opt/flink/jobs/data.csv',
    'format' = 'csv'
);"

Please generate a sample csv file with 50 entries to work with this.
